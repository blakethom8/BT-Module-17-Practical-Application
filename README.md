# BT-Module-17-Practical-Application

Found in this repository are my results of the Practical Application Module 17 Assignmenmt. 
For this assignment, we explored how different classification models could predict whether banking customers would respond to campaign or not. 
A large focus of the work is on building a Logistic Regression Model and tuning that model. 
I had challenges outperforming the baseline accuracy. I believe this is mostly a result of a large imbalance of our dataset. For example, ~90% of the customers do not respond to the campaigns. Thus, for the results of my initial Logistic Regression model, the model predicted that all customers would not be responsive to the campaign. 
While this had a high accuracy, it had poor recall or precision. 
I explored adjusted the probability parameters to tune the model for recall and precision and how that could skew the results to a more favorable position, based on your business case.
